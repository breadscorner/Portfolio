        My professional odyssey began in leadership roles, from managing
        bustling restaurants to steering construction sites as a foreman.
        However, a pivotal moment came when I discovered my newfound passion for
        web development. This revelation unfolded during the creation of a
        website for my retail venture, Precious Pawz.

        The allure of web development captivated me, prompting a radical shift
        in my career trajectory. Determined to hone my skills, I enrolled in the
        Full Stack Web Development program at the esteemed British Columbia
        Institute of Technology (BCIT).

        As I navigate through the program, each completed term brings me closer
        to mastering the intricate dance between front-end and back-end
        technologies. BCIT has not only broadened my technical prowess but has
        also enriched my design acumen.

        achieve this through regular exercise and participation in various
        sports.

        or Europe, I revel in discovering new facets of the world.
